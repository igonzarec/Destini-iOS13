This is a practice project from 

#  Destini

The goal of this is implementing the MVC design pattern and thinking about the state of the app. In addition, I review Structures and using them to separate the Model from the Controller. 

In this app, I'll be creating a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience
